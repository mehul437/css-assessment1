    <h3>What is CSS?</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet.</li>
        <br>
        <li>CSS describes how HTML elements to be displayed on screen,paper,or in other media.</li>
        <br>
        <li><span class="lis">CSS is not neccessay</span><span class="back"> CSS saves a lot of work.</span>It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.</li>
        <br>
        <li><span class="lis4"> External Stylesheet are stored in CSS files</span>.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>CSS can be added to HTML document in 3 ways:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements</li>
        <li>Internal - bys using a style element in head section</li>
        <li>External - by suing a link element to link to an External file</li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS ,to keep style in External CSS file.however <span class="back"> in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styling,</span> because it is easier to demonstrate and easier for you to try it yourself.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        when comparing CSS class vs ID ,the difference is that the class implies style to multiple elements.ID on other hand implies styling toone unique element,ID is also special in that you can use a special url link directly to an element and it is used by javascript.

    </p>
    <p>In CSS, slectors are used to target specific element or a range of elment in a webpage.ONce a element has been targeted, astyle or set of style can be applied to that element</p>
    <p>There is a wide rangeof selector available.Two of the most commonly used are class and id,both are used to target a element which a style should be applied.</p>
